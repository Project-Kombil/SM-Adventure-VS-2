            As the <a src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar">Pablo Ascobar</a> of the <b>DUCK RACE</b>, Uncle Ducko ran multiple chains of drug nests across the globe.
            Over the course of 5 years, his wealth grew and  Uncle Duck became the richest duck on Earth. Even the federal duck army kept their distance from Uncle Ducko's Land and Properties.

        <p>
            Unfortunately every duck has to move on into the afterlife and his wealth and family name was at stake for he had no children to pass on his wealth to.
            But far off in another pond was his nephews, his Christian brother's sons Ducky, and Duckoo. 
        </p>
        <P>But he only needed only one duck. It was a tough decision because they both had their strengths in different academic fields so Uncle Ducko had to choose between...</P>
