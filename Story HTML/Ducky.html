        <p>
            Ducky was no ordinary duckling when he was born. He was born with a calculator! It was no ordinary calculator, it was the <b>FX 2000 X92A D3A2 Model!</b> 
            <br>
            This calculator was only used by the wizards of NASA when exploring other planets. But this duckling grew up learning the art of calculaton  through this special calculator.

            Designing his first <b>Missile Homing Software</b> at the age 2, Ducky was a well respected Engineer among all the engineers around the world. 
            Because of his intelligence, internet giant Google hired him right before his second birthday.
