            Ducky was no ordinary duckling when he was born. He was born with a calculator! It was no ordinary calculator, it was the <b>FX 2000 X92A D3A2 Model!</b> The most expensive calculator of that age.
            This calculator was only used by the wizards of NASA when out exploring other planets for signs of life. But this duckling grew up learning the art of calculaton with the help of this this special calculator.

            Rumours have been going around that he even helped his Uncle Ducko in getting past the US borders through an old railway tunnel underground. He used his connections with the US government to grant access for his uncle to deal drugs within the big cities of the United States.
